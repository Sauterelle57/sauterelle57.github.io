## üëã‚Äã Introduction
<p align="justify">
This document is the delivery of the user interface design mini-project in the SOEN 357 course. The aim of this assignment is to follow a structured UX/UI design process to develop a visual prototype of a mobile application, applying the principles studied in class. This process includes several key steps, such as <a href="#-understanding-the-problem">understanding the problem</a>, <a href="#-research--analysis">researching</a> existing solutions, potential user data, <a href="#-fonctionnalities">feature list</a>, creating a <a href="#-persona">persona</a> and <a href="#-empathize-map">empathy map</a>, <a href="#%EF%B8%8F-journey-map">journey map</a>, <a href="#-story-board">storyboarding</a>, <a href="#%EF%B8%8F-sketches">sketching</a>, implementing a <a href="#%EF%B8%8F-user-flow">user flow</a>, creating a <a href="#%EF%B8%8F-wireframes">wireframe</a>, thinking about <a href="#-style">style</a>, then the <a href="#-final-result">final result</a> and a <a href="#-conclusion">conclusion</a>. Each stage of the project will be detailed, highlighting the design choices made, the iterations carried out and the solutions proposed. The final result consists of visual prototypes of the application created with figma.
</p>

<br>

## ü§î Understanding the Problem
<p align="justify">
The aim of the project is to design a mobile application dedicated to travelers, in particular those traveling alone or to high-risk countries prone to unpredictable events. In these contexts, travelers need frequently updated and verified information, such as travel restrictions, dangers to avoid, local laws and available services. The main objective is to create an intuitive application that not only offers standard travel functions, but also provides quick access to information concerning risk zones, safety rules, health conditions and possible restrictions or conflicts. The application must bring together several services so that users can manage their journeys feeling safe, informed and accompanied, even alone and in unpredictable situations or unfamiliar countries.
</p>
<br>

## üîç Research & Analysis

<p align="justify">
Before I started thinking about my app design, I researched existing apps to understand the features and designs used in the travel industry. Among the applications I studied was Opodo, which offers a full range of travel-related services. This analysis enabled me to identify the strengths and limitations of current solutions, and to draw inspiration from them to design an application that meets the specific needs of my users while offering an enhanced experience.
</p>

</p>
<br>



### App Name
<p align="justify">
The choice of the name <strong>SwayAway</strong> is the fruit of reflection around the core values I wanted to convey through my application: simplicity, serenity and the desire to escape. I was looking for a name that evoked both travel and the feeling of calm, without complexity, that I imagined for the user.
<br>
The word ‚ÄúSway‚Äù came to mind, thinking of the idea of letting yourself be guided naturally, as if swaying slightly, carried by a breeze or a wave. It perfectly captured the fluidity and lightness I wanted to convey. ‚ÄúAway‚Äù came next, evoking the sense of escape and discovery of new horizons that many travelers seek. Combining these two terms, SwayAway was born, reflecting the idea of a soothed, obstacle-free journey, where every step is designed to offer a fluid, enjoyable experience.
  <br>
  <br>
The name SwayAway perfectly reflects the spirit of the application: an invitation to let yourself be carried away by the sweetness of travel, while keeping simplicity and serenity at the heart of the experience.
</p>
<br>


## üôÇ Persona
<p align="justify">
  I created the Aiko Sato persona to better understand the needs and expectations of a key user of my app: a solo traveler looking for safety and convenience. By defining her characteristics, fears and frustrations, I was able to focus on features that addressed her concerns, such as the need for reliable, real-time information and personalized guidance. This persona helped me guide the design process, taking into account the real challenges faced by travelers like Aiko.
</p>

</p>
<br>

## ü§ù Empathize Map
<p align="justify">
  J'ai √©labor√© la carte d'empathie pour Aiko Sato afin d'approfondir ma compr√©hension de ses √©motions, motivations et exp√©riences en tant que voyageuse solo. Cet outil visuel me permet de visualiser ce qu'Aiko pense, ressent, dit et fait dans le contexte de ses voyages. En identifiant ses besoins, ses frustrations et ses aspirations, j'ai pu mieux cerner comment mon application pourrait l'accompagner tout au long de son parcours. La carte d'empathie est essentielle pour m'assurer que le design et les fonctionnalit√©s r√©pondent v√©ritablement aux attentes d'utilisateurs comme Aiko, en favorisant une exp√©rience utilisateur positive et adapt√©e √† leurs r√©alit√©s.

</p>
<br>

## üó∫Ô∏è‚Äã Journey Map

<p align="justify">
I created a user map to visualize the user's complete journey through the application, step by step. This tool enabled me to analyze how a user interacts with the various functionalities, from opening the application to achieving their objectives (such as searching for travel information or managing their reservations).
<br>
By building this map, I was able to identify potential friction points and optimize the navigation flow to make the experience as fluid and intuitive as possible. This approach helped me to better understand the user's needs at each stage of their journey, while ensuring that the application remained simple and pleasant to use.
</p>
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/journey_map.jpg" alt="Journey_Map">
</p>
<br>

## ‚úàÔ∏è‚Äã User Flow
<p align="jusitify">
I was then able to create a user flow to understand the different steps a user would go through when using the application. This user flow illustrates the steps a user follows to find and book a trip through the application. The main objective is to make the process as fluid and intuitive as possible for the user, minimizing the number of steps and providing an optimal user experience.
</p>
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/user_flow.jpg" alt="User_Flow" height="1400">
</p>
<br>

## üìñ Story Board
<p align="justify">
I designed a storyboard to illustrate the user journey in a visual and narrative way. This tool enabled me to tell the story of the user as he interacts with the application, showing how he moves from one stage to the next. Through visual scenarios, I was able to identify the emotions and potential reactions of the user at different moments in his experience.
<br>
Storyboarding helped me to understand not only the user's actions, but also the motivations and obstacles he might encounter when using the application. By narrating these key moments, I was able to fine-tune the design and ensure that each feature corresponded to the real needs and expectations of users.
</p>
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/story_board.png" alt="Story_Board">
</p>
<br>

## ‚úèÔ∏è Sketches
<p align="justify">
I created sketches to lay the initial visual foundations of the application. They enabled me to quickly translate my ideas into concrete sketches, in order to visualize the layout of elements and the arrangement of different interfaces. This process helped me to explore several concepts without being limited by technical details, and to test different configurations before moving on to more detailed mock-ups.
<br>
By sketching out these initial ideas, I was able to concentrate on the essentials: functionality and fluidity of the user experience. These sketches served as a guide throughout the visual development, ensuring that the aesthetic choices made respected the application's initial objective.
</p>
<br>

## üñºÔ∏è Wireframes

<p align="justify">
I created wireframes to define the basic structure of my application before getting into the visual details. Wireframes allowed me to focus on the hierarchy of information, the placement of elements and overall navigation without worrying about aesthetic aspects at this stage. They were essential for testing and validating the layout of functionalities, ensuring that the application was intuitive and easy to use.
<br>
By working on the wireframes, I was able to ensure that each screen responded effectively to the user's needs, while maintaining consistency in the navigation flow. This step laid a solid foundation on which to build the final visual design.

<br>

## üé® Style
### Color Palette
<p align="justify">
  For the styling of my app, I drew inspiration from real-life elements that evoke both travel and tranquility. I wanted to capture the serenity one feels lounging on a beach, under the sun, surrounded by palm trees and the gentle sound of the waves. Images of planes soaring into clear skies and a tranquil sea add a dimension of adventure and exploration. By integrating these visual elements, I hope to create an interface that evokes sensations of freedom and relaxation, while facilitating the user experience for those who dream of traveling.
</p>
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/search_style.jpg" alt="search_style">
</p>
<br>
<p align="jusitify">
In the process of visually creating my app, I tested several color palettes before finding the combination that I felt best suited the spirit of the app. This research turned out to be a rather straightforward, but above all very inspiring part for me. I explored different shades, seeking to balance contrasting and soothing tones that evoke both adventure and serenity. The final choice of colors reflects the essence of the journey while ensuring a pleasant visual experience for the user.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/palette.png" alt="Color_palette" width="80%">
</p>
<br>
<br>

### Logo

<p align="justify">
In designing this logo, I thought about the symbolic elements that immediately evoke travel and adventure. I wanted to incorporate visual representations that are universally associated with travel and the discovery of new horizons.
So I decided to combine three key elements: the sun, to symbolize the escape, warmth and light of new experiences; the boat, as a representation of sea travel, evoking exploration and freedom; and finally, the airplane, which embodies modern, fast and global travel.
</p>
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/inspiration_logo.png" alt="search_style" width="300">
</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">
The combination of these three elements in the logo reflects the idea of movement, the diversity of means of transport, and the beauty of the landscapes to be discovered on each journey.
After assembling the sun, the boat and the plane to create the logo, I wanted to explore different visual options by declining it in the colors of my palette. This allowed me to test various combinations and see how the colors could reinforce the values and energy I wanted to convey through the design. This declination process was essential in deciding which color theme I wanted to use for my final result.

<p align="justify">
This process allowed me to test the visual impact of each option. In the end, I chose a version with contrasting, fairly warm colors, always with the idea of reflecting the energy and emotion associated with travel. And above all, the logo that visually appealed to me the most and inspired me the most.

### Font
<br>
<p align="justify">
To choose the right font for my application, I evaluated several options based on essential criteria such as legibility, aesthetics and consistency with the application's image. My goal was to find a font that was modern, elegant and easy to read on a mobile interface.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <strong>Afacad Flux<br></strong>
This sans-serif font is both elegant and lightweight, making it attractive for headings and subheadings. However, its thinness can sometimes impair legibility on small screens, especially when text is reduced.
</p>
<p align="left">
  <img src="assets/fonts/Afacad Flux.png" alt="logo" height="200">
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <strong>Aptos<br></strong>
Although this font offers excellent support for non-Latin characters, it's not as suitable for a predominantly Latin-script application. It didn't match the modern visual universe I wanted to create.
</p>
<p align="left">
  <img src="assets/fonts/Aptos.png" alt="logo" height="200">
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <strong>Jost<br></strong>
This font stands out for its balance between modernity and legibility. Its clean, rounded design adds a warm touch while remaining highly legible, even at smaller sizes. It adapts well to the different types of content in the application, whether for titles, subtitles or body text.
</p>
<p align="left">
  <img src="assets/fonts/Jost.png" alt="logo" height="200">
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <strong>Noto Sans Oriya<br></strong>
Although this font was very unique and stylish, it lacked versatility for everyday use in an application. It could have worked in a very specific context, but risked detracting from the user experience due to its complex shape.
</p>
<p align="left">
  <img src="assets/fonts/Noto Sans Oriya.png" alt="logo" height="200">
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <strong>Raleway<br></strong>
Modern and slightly geometric, Aptos has excellent potential for an application interface. Its clarity and balanced character make it ideal for long texts, but it lacked the distinctive look required to reflect the serenity of travel.
</p>
<p align="left">
  <img src="assets/fonts/Raleway.png" alt="logo" height="200">
</p>
<br>

## üåü Final Result

<p align="justify">
I was finally able to use the wireframe bases to create the final result on Figma. Starting from the structure and functionalities defined in the wireframes, I was able to refine the visual details and design an interface, integrating examples and more context. This passage from wireframes to the final prototype enabled me to bring the application more life and visualy show how the app would look like. This part took me the longest to do.

## ‚ùî Conclusion

<p align="justify">
In conclusion, this project enabled me to explore every key stage of the UX/UI design process, from initial research to the creation of final prototypes. I followed a structured methodology that helped me understand the needs of target users, through the creation of personas, empathy maps, sketches and wireframes. Drawing on real-life references and visual inspirations evocative of travel and serenity, I was able to design an application that combines functionality and aesthetics. Every design decision was guided by the desire to offer travelers a fluid, intuitive and secure experience.
The final prototypes reflect these priorities, while incorporating user feedback and best practices in interactive design. Finally, the project was carried out on Figma, and is the result of numerous iterations aimed at offering a solution adapted to travelers in search of safety and simplicity.
